# Wp products

The program was created due to lack of woo comerce extension which allows user to create 
variant product price using base product price. Due to big amount of products (about 1000) and
price fluctuations changing the prices at least once in a month will be unefficient.
Program uses two templates. First one is containg all the product fields and the second one only the columns
which are not being modyfied. Using .csv program fill cells of dataframe with data about item
and create variants for all products with custom description and price depending on main 
product.
